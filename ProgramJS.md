# Programming with JavaScript

- JavaScript has both binary and unary operators, and one special ternary operator, the conditional operator.
  - A binary operator requires two operands, one before the operator and one after the operator:
  - operand1 operator operand2
  - For example, 3+4 or x*y
- A unary operator requires a single operand, either before or after the operator
  - operator operand or 
  - operand operator
  - EX: x++ or ++x
- An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand
- The simple assignment operator is equal
  - EX: x = y
- An arithmetic operator takes numerical values as their operands and returns a single numerical value.
- A bitwise operator treats their operands as a set of 32 bits (zeros and ones), rather than as decimal, hexadecimal, or octal numbers.
- A unary operation is an operation with only one operand.
- An expression is any valid unit of code that resolves to a value.
- Left values are the destination of an assignment.
- A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedureâ€” a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value
- A function definition consists of the function keyword, followed by:
  - The name of the function.
  - A list of parameters to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.
  - The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, {...}
- Function expressions can be anonymous; it does not have to have a name
- Defining a function does not execute it. Defining it names the function and specifies what to do when the function is called.
- Calling the function actually performs the specified actions with the indicated parameters

## Control Flow
- The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script
- To do this, the script uses a conditional structure or if...else
