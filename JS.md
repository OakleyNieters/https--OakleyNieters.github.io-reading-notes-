# JavaScript

- JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative styles.
- Variables are containers for storing data (values).
- All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names called identifiers.
   - Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
   - Names must begin with a letter
   - Names can also begin with $ and _ 
   - Names are case sensitive 
   - Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names
- The equal sign (=) is an "assignment" operator, not an "equal to" operator.
- In programming, text values are called text strings.
  - Strings are written inside double or single quotes.
  - Numbers are written without quotes.
- Creating a variable in JavaScript is called "declaring" a variable.
  - You declare a JavaScript variable with the var keyword:
  - EX: var carName = "Volvo";
  - It's a good programming practice to declare all variables at the beginning of a script.
  - You can declare many variables in one statement.
  - Start the statement with var and separate the variables by comma: var person = "John Doe", carName = "Volvo", price = 200;
  - A variable declared without a value will have the value undefined.
