**Growth Mindset**

The best way to describe a growth mindset is to think of different groups of people. Are you in the group that doesn't limit themselves? Or, are you in the group that sees an obstacle and runs the other way? Even if you are currently in a fixed mindset, or have been in the past, it's never too late to start a growth mindset! 

- [] Stay focused on your goals
- [] Don't get discouraged by criticism
- [] Learn from the success of others
