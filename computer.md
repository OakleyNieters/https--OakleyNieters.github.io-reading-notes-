**The Command Line**
  - A text based interface to the system.
  - Enter commands on the keyboard and feedback will come back.
      - Line 1 shows a prompt, then enter a command which is the first thing you type, after that we have command line arguments. There must be a space
        between the command and the command line arguments. Options are used to modify behaviour of the command. Options usually start with a dash.
      - Line 2-5 are are output running the command. Most commands produce output and will be listed under issuing of the command. 
        Other commands perform their task and don't show any info unless there was an error.
      - Line 6 after command has run and terminal is ready for another command. 
  - Mac Terminal is under Applications> Utilities.
 
 **Shell**
  - The part that defines how terminal will behave and looks after running commands.
  - Most common shell is called Bash

**Basic Navigation**
  - PWD or Print Working Directory tells you what your current directory is.
  - Location or ls tells us what is there.
  - Path is a means get to a particular file or directory on the system.
  - There are 2 types of paths we can use absolute and relative.
      - Relative path a file or directory location relative to where we currently are in the file system.
      - Absolute path a file or directory location in relation to the root of the file system.
  - Root directory is at the very top of the struccture, shown by a single slash (/).
  - Absolute paths specify a location in relation to the root directory. 
     -You can identify them easily as they always begin with a forward slash ( / )
  - Relative paths specify a location (file or directory) in relation to where we currently are in the system. They will not begin with a slash.
  - Tilde ~ This is a shortcut for your home directory. eg, if your home directory is /home/oakley then you could refer to the directory
    documents with the path /home/oakley/Documents or ~/Documents
  - Dot . This is a reference to your current directory.
  - Dotdot .. This is a reference to the parent directory.
  - Change Directory or cd usually will be run with a single command line argument which is the location we would like to change into.

**Files**
  - Everything is a file!
  - Common file extensions:
      - file.exe - an executable file, or program
      - file.txt - a plain text file
      - file.png, file.gif, file.jpg - an image
  - In other systems the extension is important in determining what kind of file it is.
  - Linux ignores the extension and looks inside the file to determine what it is.
      - Linux is case sensitive
  - Spaces in file names are seen as 2 different program names.
      - Instead use quotes or Escape Characters.
      - Another method is to use what is called an escape character, which is a backslash ( \ ).
      - What the backslash does is escape the special meaning of the next character.
  - Hidden files begin with a (full stop)
