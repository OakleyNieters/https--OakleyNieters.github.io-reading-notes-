# CSS

## What is CSS?

- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great-looking web pages by controlling exactly how the elements look.
- CSS is a rule-based language â€” you define rules specifying groups of styles that should be applied to particular elements or groups of elements on your web page.
- EX: "color" is the property the "value" is red.
- External CSS- With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!
  - External styles are defined within the <link> element, inside the <head> section of an HTML page.
  - Must be saved with a .css extension.
  - Do not add a space between the property value and the unit
- Internal CSS- An internal style sheet may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style.
  - Internal styles are defined within the <style> element, inside the <head> section of an HTML page.
- Inline CSS- Inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element.
  - To use inline styles, add the style attribute to the relevant element. The style attribute can contain any CSS property.
- Multiple Style Sheets- If some properties have been defined for the same selector (element) in different style sheets, the value from the last read style sheet will be used. 
- Cascading Order- All the styles in a page will "cascade" into a new "virtual" style sheet by the following rules, where number one has the highest priority:
  1. Inline style (inside an HTML element)
  2. External and internal style sheets (in the head section)
  3. Browser default
